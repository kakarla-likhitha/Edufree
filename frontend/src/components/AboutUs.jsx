      <p>
        EduFree is a non-profit initiative aimed at empowering children in rural
        communities by providing free and quality education through volunteer
        support.
      </p>
      <p>
        We bridge the gap between passionate individuals and under-resourced
        areas, ensuring that every child has a chance to learn and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through weekend programs, workshops, and regular classes, our volunteers
        create a strong learning environment and inspire young minds to dream
        big.
